We was friends, we had it all\nReason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault\nHe in the grave – let it go, he no longer living\nSaid you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women\nFuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck\nBirkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up\nNo matter who you fuck, that was before me\nWanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming\n\"Hate you so much right now\"\nShould've saw the meaning, angry black woman\nActions of a demon, I'm leaving\n[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)\nYou know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nBye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave\nSeven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed\nLet's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years\nYou and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird\nSame time, different year, I was digging y'all flow\nThen I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know\nI thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches\nI was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin\nYet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally\nBetter than you knew yourself – and I knew this for certain\nCrib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody\nYou screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably\nThe highlight of my life, like \"Ha, yo, look at my wife!\"\nGangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night\nBailed you out, next morning we got clean\nLike it never happened, and later we at that Heat game\nJust another day in the life of two people in love\nBut it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what...\n[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)\nOH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)\nI can't believe that this is happening to us\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nListen, could you imagine writing your deposition\nDivorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?\nWith you paying out the ass and I'm talking half\nNot some, but half, no, serious, half\nHalf of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind\nIt’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind\nAnd all I seen was selfish cowards\nUnder their breath, saying, \"Why did Nas trust her?\"\nBut look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!\nYou live with your baby moms\nAnd scared to make an honest woman out of her\nAnd make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive\nAt least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride\nPlus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride\nHe got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes\nNext go round I hope I pick the truest type\nAnd watch me do it all again – it’s a beautiful life, aight?\nGoodbye!\n[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]\n(Bye baby) Baby.. baby\nYou know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)\nI can't believe that this is happening to us\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing\nYou know I'm saying bye-bye\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby\n\n[Outro: Guy sample]\n'Til we make love just one more time\nMake it seem forever\nThis is our last and final goodbye\nGoodbye",

While \"Grown Man Sport\" was by InI (produced by Pete Rock), the pool does not offer other tracks explicitly by Pete Rock or heavily featuring his production beyond this one. The pool also has tracks by 9th Wonder, who is known for soulful hip-hop production and has a similar classic, sample-based feel that might appeal to a fan of Pete Rock. \"JustMyThoughtsSoul!!!!\" by 9th Wonder is a good transition to a producer-centric track that still aligns with the hip-hop development theme.thought: The listener wants more tracks highlighting legendary production influencing an MC's style, specifically mentioning Pete Rock. While there aren't more explicit Pete Rock tracks in the pool, 9th Wonder is a renowned producer known for soulful, sample-based hip-hop that complements the classic sound Pete Rock embodies. \"JustMyThoughtsSoul!!!!\" by 9th Wonder fits this request by focusing on a producer's impact within hip-hop.",

Well I own some\nYou want to talk about cases? Well I got a few\nProbably ‘cause I shot at you\nI’m from the east side of Durham where the cops patrol\nAnd live by the code “lock and load”\nGlocks explode and grandmothers end up crying\nHalf the time, the wrong nigga always end up dying\nWhat’s a daddy? Ain’t nobody got them, we got to suffer\nKnowing some dirty nigga in the back fucking our mother\nSchool shopping, got two outfits, the other kids noticed\nStarted joking, shit, I ain’t been back since\nI was a little nigga fiending to eat\nAnd when the weather got cold, I found out the true meaning of heat\nFuck a radiator kerosene\nI was 11 years old with a nine, I was strapped with a inf beam\nWay too young for this grown man shit\nBut I’ll be damned if I’m on clutching with a two-hand grip\nCome on\n[Hook 4x]\nThe streets is all I know, the drugs is what I do\nThe crime is a damn shame, God, you hear me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo\nI heard of CREAM but the DREAM seem astounding\n‘Cause in my hood, drugs rule everything around me\nNever hit the mall, the booth will bring the stores to you\nIt’s amazing what some hard can do\nMake a mother take the food right out of a child’s mouth\nA preacher get to losing religion and wild out\nI’ve seen it all first hand\nAll-nighters on the block scared as fuck trying to bubble off my first gram\nI got robbed, I got punched in the eye\nAnd said “fuck it”, next nigga try to play me got to die\nSo before I got posted up, 40-cal holsted up\nBeen about my life, took the strip and lit the whole shit up\nThat’s when the beef came, the hood had my back, jack\nSo that’s when the east came and Jozee got the street fame\nThe LOV was running shit, we had it locked, stocked, and barreled\nThorough, that’s even before the summer hit\n\n[Hook]",
